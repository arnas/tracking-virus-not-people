# Tracking Virus Not People


An interactive map of Covid-19 cases in Lithuania which is able:
1) To evaluate your personal Covid-19 risk based on your Google timeline (all calculations are performed in your web browser and NO DATA IS SENT TO SERVER)
2) Provide a score how well are you preserving a quarantine. The score is shareable and its aim is to promote a social responsibility.

Covid-19 cases dataset is collected based on Lithaunian National epidemiology center data (https://nvsc.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/covid-19-atveju-epidemiologinio-tyrimo-rezultatai).
Please feel free to contribute with new cases either in the Tracking-Virus-Not-People platform or by contacting us directly.
